initial thoughts:
perhaps older passengers died at a higher rate than younger?
older as in 60+ or something along those lines
most likely a positive correlation between Pclass and survival
kids probably survived at better rate than adults
would the port matter?
for all i know some people got off before the titanic made its way
to NY
women over men
